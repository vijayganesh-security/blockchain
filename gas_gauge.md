# Gas Gauge: A Security Analysis Tool for Smart Contract Out-of-Gas Vulnerabilities


## Overview
In recent years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in the adoption and application of smart contracts in a variety of contexts. However, security vulnerabilities pose a significant challenge to the continued adoption of smart contracts. An important and pervasive class of security vulnerabilities that afflicts Ethereum smart contracts is the gas limit DoS on a contract via unbounded operations. These vulnerabilities result in a failed transaction with an "out-of-gas" error and are often present in contracts containing loops whose bounds are affected by end- user input. To address this issue, we present Gas Gauge, a tool aimed at detecting Out-of-Gas DoS vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. The Gas Gauge tool has three major components: The Detection Phase, Identification Phase, and Correction Phase. The Detection Phase component consists of an accurate static analysis approach that finds and summarizes all the loops in a smart contract. The Identification Phase component uses a white-box fuzzing approach to generate a set of inputs that causes the contract to run out of gas. Lastly, the Correction Phase component uses static analysis and run-time verification to predict the maximum loop bounds consistent with allowable gas usage and suggest appropriate repairs to the toolâ€™s users. Each part of Gas Gauge can be used separately or all together to detect, identify and help repair contracts vulnerable to Out-of-Gas DoS vulnerabilities. 

Gas Gauge was tested on 1,000 real-world solidity smart contracts. When compared to seven state-of-the-art tools, we show that Gas Gauge is the most effective (i.e., has no false positives and false negatives) while being competitive in terms of efficiency.
